# noframework.js

noframework.js is a tiny javascript framework that i wrote, it's only 200 lines of code.

If you are asking yourself 'what can I do with a 200 lines framework?' the answer is this website. It's really challenging to create a functional framework from scratch, I haven't figured it yet so if you want to use noframework.js for your next awesome project you can but just keep in mind that this project is not production ready.
