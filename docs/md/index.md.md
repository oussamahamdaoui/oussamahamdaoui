# Hello, my name is Oussama and I'm a dev

My name is Oussama Hamdaoui, im a computer scientist and I live in Lille (France), an amazing place if you love 🌧️. 
I have studied Math and Physics in school but I ended up choosing computer science (the best of sciences ever)
My main interests in life are coding, football, traveling and... food 🍔

I worked as web developer at AXA, since I started there in 2018 I have learned a loot about clean code, TDD, BDD, and agile.
Like every developer I have a favorite language JavaScript ❤️ but I often have to use Java, C# or Python (really cool language by the way).
Writing code is amazing, but there are other technologies that i learned:
I have done continuous integration with circle ci and jenkins and automated tests with code  climate. Almost all the code I write is tested, I use Jest and Mocha
for the javascript code and JUnit for java. For the data persistency, I have used MySQL, Oracle, DB2, and SQL Server and with the rise of javascript I learned
MongoDB and I have some notions of Elastic Search (I can do simple requests and use buckets 😎.
You can find my projects on my GitHub page if you want to know more.
